The last two days in San Fran were unbearably hot, upwards of 36 degrees!!  On Thursday I took a nice ride on a catamaran, the "photos are online":https://www.flickr.com/photos/daveharris/sets/72157623607226279.  That made the heat bearable, but typically there wasn't really enough wind!!  No one knew what to do with themselves so most were lying under trees in the park...

On Friday I took the tram on the steepest line, California Street.  I then had a look around Chinatown.  SF has the biggest Chinatown outside of China itself.  There were heaps of little stores selling all sorts of things, I could even buy a Samurai sword, I was kinda tempted.  Everything was really cheap, about half price of the other stores on Fisherman's Wharf!  I then went up to the famous Castro district which is famous for being the gay and lesbian capital of the world.  The day before, California made it legal for same sex couples to marry (to much opposition) and so the streets were decorated and people were still celebrating.  But it was again about 35 degrees so it was too hot to do anything.  It seemed that most people were sitting under the trees in Union Square, or shopping in the air conditioned boutiques!

I flew out Friday night SF time...
