This is how to set a program (or daemon) to run at boot.  For example, if you want to run at cron at boot (which you would) issue the following as root.

<pre>
  <code>
  /sbin/chkconfig --add crond
  /sbin/chkconfig --level 2345 crond on
  </code>
</pre>

You can then confirm that it has worked by looking at @/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S<number>crond@ (eg S90crond).
