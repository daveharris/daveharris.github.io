I've had this little problem for a while now and can't fix it so ive resrted to asking the guru's at Sun's java forums.Â  You can see my post <a title="here" href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5233736">here</a>

If you can help me, please answer it there for all to see, and post a comment on here ;)
