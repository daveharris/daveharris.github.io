title: Standup Desks at Boost
---

I have been working for [Boost New Media](http://boost.co.nz) for about
2 years - all of which sitting a desk all day long. I know the bad
effects of sitting all day, like Deep Vein Thrombosis etc.

I have been following [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) for a
number of years and I was interested to read that [she switched to a
standing
desk](http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk).
As she was a fellow software developer, her journey held more weight.
One year later, she [blogged about how she found the last year
standing](http://lifehacker.com/5881393/one-year-at-my-standing-desk).
At the time my then-current employer was not going to switch the 150 or
so people all to standing desks, so it slipped into ‘one of these days’
category where things very rarely return from.

Then, working at Boost, my boss got the idea of switching the company to
standing desks. There was initial interest, so 3 desks were ordered as a
trial.

I was super keen to try them out so jumped on board the initial trial. I
knew from reading, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy …

However, I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was. There have been
multiple benefits so far:

-   Generally feeling much better. My shoulders are broader and less
    hunched and thus feel like I can breath deeper
-   Stretching while standing is much easier and therefore more likely
    to happen naturally
-   Conversations seem to be more concise and more frequent, which for a
    company which values \[individuals and interactions over processes
    and tools":http://agilemanifesto.org) is always a good thing
-   It has mixed the teams up. While working in the trial pod of 3 I
    stood with 2 other people who wanted to stand, not who I worked with
    on my project
-   At night when watching TV on the couch, it feels like a well
    deserved rest which is great!
-   Sitting at lunchtime feeling amazing, especially if you can sit with
    your feet elevated somewhat
-   Moving desk is an excellent chance to clear all the old cruft which
    accumulates over time
-   As we have motorised desks, they can be converted into normal desks
    within 10 seconds meaning that you don’t feel like you need to push
    yourself to stand all day (which I hear is a bad thing initially)
-   I am much more inclined to move around the office to talk to people.
    Also, because it’s hard work, I often change the way I stand which
    is good as people often say it doesn’t matter how you sit, but you
    need to change position every 30 mins

However, there a few ‘negatives’, at least initially:

-   Sore feet and knees. After a few days standing (with occasional
    sitting on tall chairs) my heels and inner knees are pretty sore.
    I’m not sure how much of my knee soreness can be contributed to my
    almost-torn ACL (a long story). We are investigating getting mats or
    maybe wearing old soft running shoes in the office
-   The desk may not be high enough for you. I am tall (\~6 ft 3in), but
    not a giant and I have the desk at it’s maximum height. It’s not
    exactly right, it would ideally be an inch or so higher. This may be
    fixed by wearing bare feet or raising the desk off the floor
-   We do daily standups as part of our Scrum agile process, and
    sometimes this is a little painful after standing for a long time
    just prior. Maybe we should harden up!
-   I was very easily distracted for the first few days as people asked
    how it was going and my body was sore. This has reduced as the
    novelty wore off

I have now been standing for 7 working days and am loving it. My feet
and knees are still sore, but I hope that will reduce soon. We will see!

I plan to blog semi-regularly about standing desks so watch this
space. Boost has also [blogged about standing
desks](http://www.boost.co.nz/blog/environment/why-stand-up/)
