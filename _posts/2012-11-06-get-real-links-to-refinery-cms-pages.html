<p>Getting a link to a Refinery CMS Page is harder than you think. To get it to produce the link including parent paths etc use:</p>

```ruby
refinery.url_for(@page.url_marketable)
```

<p>This will return something like:</p><pre>/about-this-site/terms-of-use</pre><p>Easy right?! There doesn't seem to be any documentation about this, you are just meant to know.</p>
