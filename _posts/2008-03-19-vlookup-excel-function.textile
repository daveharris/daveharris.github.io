Have you ever had list of status flags that have a meaning and within excel be able to change the number for the actual meaning?  Then this is for you!

Assume you have this data:

|_. Customer Id |_. Payment Type |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 |

And you have a set of Payment Types:

|_. Payment Type Code |_. Payment Description |
| 0 | Cash |
| 1 | Eftpos |
| 2 | Credit Card |

If you have this data in an Excel spreadsheet you can use the VLOOKUP Function to translate these numbers into meanings.  The VLOOKUP function is defined as VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup) where:

* lookup_value: the id that is to be looked up
* table_array: the table which holds the key and the value (can be on another sheet)
* col_index_num: the column number within the table which holds the value
* range_lookup: boolean to specify if 'approximate' values should be looked up

Therefore a simple formula could be: <code>=VLOOKUP(B15, A26:B29, 2, FALSE)</code>

If you need to perform this action on a whole table of data and need to keep it in a constant column, and the lookup table is on another sheet, this can be used: <code>=VLOOKUP(B2,Sheet2!$A$2:$B$5, 2, FALSE)</code>

I cannot claim the credit for this albeit simple and well-documented function, all credit goes to "Phil Wheeler":http://www.youstupidpumpkin.com
