I haven’t had a chance to write a post about yesterday’s bus tour around
San Fran and Sausalito but I will do that tonight.  I have a had my
first sleep in and am now about to leave (10.30am) for a look around the
Financial District, Fisherman’s Wharf and I am planning to go to the San
Fran Giants vs Philidephia Phillies baseball game this afternoon.

There are photos from the last few days of JavaOne and then [some nice
shots from
yesterday](https://www.flickr.com/photos/daveharris/sets/72157623607213427)
(there are even some photos of me to prove that I’ve been there!).  Mum
and Dad, don’t you have same photo of Golden Gate when you were there (a
million years ago)? :P  How cool is that!

Anyway, I will update you on yesterday and today tonight.
