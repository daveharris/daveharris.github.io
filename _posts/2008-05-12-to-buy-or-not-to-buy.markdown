Of course I am talking about the iPhone.  I went into the awesome Apple
Store (I’ll take some photos next time) and was about to buy one but
they had sold out of the 16GB.

But then Dad said that it will be the same price in NZ.  So it’s \$USD
499 + 2.5% foreign exchange credit card fee = \$671.  Stuff was saying
that it was going to be \$700 in NZ.  So it’s not really any cheaper, if
\$700 is to be believed.  Has any more news come out or have Vodafone
been tight-lipped?  I assume that the \$499 includes the 8.65% sales
tax…

So do you think its worth buying it here and haking it, or should I wait
and get the official one and get too expensive 3G and GPS????  I’m sure
there will be some awesome app that uses GPS and I’ll be annoyed it
didn’t wait.

**What should I do??? Sound off in the comments please ;)**
