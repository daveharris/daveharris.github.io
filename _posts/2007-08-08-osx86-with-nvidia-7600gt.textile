This is quick and dirty how-to to get Quartz Extreme and Core Image at full resolution working on OSx86 (with OSX 10.4.8) a nVidia 7600gt 256MB card.

Follow the simple insructions below and you can't go wrong:

* Install OSx86 with the optional @Natit@ package
* Once booted find your card identifier by adding the @DeviceID@ and @VendorID@ together to get a string (mine is @0x02e110de@)
* Edit the corresponding @<string>@ tag for the @IOPCIMatch@ key in these four packages (in @/System/Library/Extensions@)
** Geforce.kext
** NVDANV40Hal.kext
** NVDANV30Hal.kext
** NVDAResman.kext

If the file is like this:

<code>
<key>IOPCIMatch</key>
<string>0x00000000&0x0000ffff</string>
</code>
Replace it with this:
<code>
<key>IOPCIMatch</key>
<string>0x02e010de&0x0000ffff</string>
</code>

If the key has a number of values in the string tag, just add @0x02e010de&0x0000ffff@ to the start of the list.</li>
* You now need to flush the kext cache so run the following:
@sudo rm /System/Library/Extensions@
* Now reboot and enjoy the goodness of Mac OSx86 :)

I cannot claim the credit for this, I got it from "a post by sinjon on the osxx86 forum":http://www.osxx86.info/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=1514  (shot mate ;) )
