This is a list of steps and resources used to set up my Dlink DNS-323 RevB NAS.

##Phase 1: Upgrade firmware

Upgrade to the [latest firmware](http://www.dlink.com.au/tech/Download/download.aspx?product=DNS-323)

##Phase 2: Correctly format 4k drives

Western Digital 4k sector drives (EARS) are not correctly formatted by the DNS-323, and [the partitions must be setup manually to align with
the cylinder boundaries](http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=14484.0).

##Phase 3: FFP

### 3.1: FFP

[Install Fonz Fun Plug (FFP)](http://nas-tweaks.net/CH3SNAS:Tutorials/fun_plug#Steps_for_installing_fun_plug) and enable ssh.
Then [setup additional packages](http://nas-tweaks.net/CH3SNAS:Tutorials/ffp-packages#Downloading_packages) and install `bash`, `dnsmasq`, `screen`, `sudo` and `vim` packages.

**Advantage**: Installs `ssh`, `telnet`, `bash` and other useful tools

**Disadvantage**: Files stored on `/ramdisk` so have to replace modified config files each reboot.  No `git` package

### 3.2: Optware

[Install optware](http://dns323.kood.org/howto:optware) which allows [many more packages](http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/dns323/cross/unstable/) to be installed.

**Advantage**: Installs `git`

**Disadvantage**: Still have to workaround ramdisk issues and fragments package management - some built-in, some in ffp, some in optware

##Phase 4: Alt-f Replacement Firmware

Debian Squeeze (testing at time of writing) is available only in the newer `armel`
architecture, not in the older `arm` architecture.  The default firmware is `arm` and therefore cannot run squeeze.

[Alt-f](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alt-f) is an alternative custom firmware
which is running on the `armel` architecture as well as supporting some
things that the default does not, such as `ext4`.  It can be run on-top of
the default firmware, but that has the same problems ramdisk problems as
before. It an replace the default firmware by flashing the device but
that seems a little dangerous and with limited benefit.  This may be
required is Lenny as no longer supported.

##Phase 5: Debian chroot

### 5.1: Debian Etch

- [Download and install Debian Etch chroot](http://dns323.kood.org/howto:chroot_debian#the_easy_way).
- [Follow the upgrade path](http://forum.dsmg600.info/viewtopic.php?pid=26426#p26426):
- Upgrade via apt-get to Debian Lenny.
- Install samba, using the standard smb.conf as a base.
- Create standard user account, lockdown ssh access

**Advantage**: No more ramdisk issues, more control over package management and running a real linux distro

**Disadvantage**: Running an old version of Debian (stable) which is `arm`, not the newer `armel` architecture (which may not be supported anyway...)

### 5.2: Debian Squeeze Chroot

[Download, create and install Debian Squeeze chroot﻿](http://forum.dsmg600.info/viewtopic.php?id=4330).

**Advantage**: A newer version (unstable) of Debian.
