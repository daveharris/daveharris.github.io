I am being sent to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a> by my employer <a href="http://www.fronde.com">Fronde</a> and am wondering if anyone else is going there from either Wellington or NZ and wants to meet up somewhere along the way or in San Fran?

Leave a comment to this post and I will email you back ;)
